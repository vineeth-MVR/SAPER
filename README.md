Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a type of natural language processing (NLP) that involves evaluating the sentiment or emotion behind a piece of text. In this paper, the authors apply sentiment analysis to public opinions of candidates on Twitter.

Here are the key steps involved in the process:

    • Data collection: Tweets related to the candidates are collected using Twitter's APIs or other methods for searching and downloading tweets.
    • Preprocessing: The collected tweets are cleaned and standardized to prepare them for analysis.
    • Sentiment analysis: A lexicon-based approach is used to determine the sentiment of each tweet, using a predefined list of words and their associated sentiment scores.
    • Polarity and subjectivity calculation: The polarity score ranges from -1 (completely negative) to 1 (completely positive) and reflects the overall positive or negative sentiment of the tweet. The subjectivity score ranges from 0 (completely objective) to 1 (completely subjective) and reflects the degree to which the tweet reflects personal opinions, feelings, or judgments.
    • Comparison of sentiment among candidates: The average polarity and subjectivity scores for each candidate are calculated and compared.
    • Word cloud generation: A word cloud is plotted showing the most frequently appearing words in the tweets, providing insights into the topics of most concern to the public with regard to the candidates

In conclusion, we have presented a method for conducting sentiment analysis on public opinions of candidates on Twitter. By collecting and analyzing tweets related to the candidates, the authors were able to determine the sentiment, polarity, and subjectivity of the tweets, and compare the sentiment among the candidates. The word cloud generated from the tweets also provided valuable insights into the topics of most concern to the public. Overall, this analysis can be a valuable tool for understanding the opinions and feelings of the public towards a particular topic or individual.
